# RO50 - CCleaner, a TurtleBot4 adventure

## Descritption

University project aiming to learn robotics fundamental by practicing on a TurtleBot4.

The goal for the robot is **to autonomously reach a place in a facility by geopositionning itself** using three methods :

- SLAM and Generated map

- Indoor localization algorithms such as N-Lateration or Fingerprint

- Follow a line on the ground using a Color Sensor

Is has been done for the Course Credits **RO50 - Robotics and embedded systems project** at <u>Université de Technologie de Belfort Montbéliard (FR).</u>
